WEBVTT

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:07.208
(creepy eerie music)

00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:46.190
(dramatic intense music)
(Mayra gasps)

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.953
- Didn't mean to startle
you. Thought I was alone.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.353
it's a good thing I didn't
get too comfortable.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.303
- Sorry.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.423
- I'm joking, of course.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.160
I admire your dedication,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.630
but you really ought to be
careful not to wear yourself out.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.380
Not that I ever took my own advice.

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.433
- In that case, neither will I.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.363
I, I don't mean that. Of course
I would take your advice.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:16.293
- (laughs) Join me for some green tea?

00:01:17.217 --> 00:01:19.467
- Uh, I probably shouldn't.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.973
- Oh, come on.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.270
No one's curing cancer

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.170
without the help of a little caffeine.

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:31.028
- Okay.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.483
(unsettling ominous music)

00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:07.285
(glass shattering)

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.909
(sirens wailing)

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.060
- Anyway, I remember coming to sort of,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.350
but I don't remember
having lost consciousness,

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.103
and then, all day I've
just been like hung over.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.963
- You sure you weren't having

00:02:37.963 --> 00:02:41.303
one of your episodes like fourth year.

00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:47.273
- (sighs) I haven't told
you the whole story.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.760
Oh god, this is so messed up.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.070
I shouldn't be embarrassed, right?

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.903
- What happened?

00:02:56.028 --> 00:03:01.028
- (sighs) Dr. Booker was inappropriate.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.460
- That's a pretty serious accusation

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.650
if you're saying what
I think you're saying.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.740
- You think it hasn't crossed my mind

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.750
what it means to say that
I was sexually harassed

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.460
by someone who is likely
to win the Nobel Prize?

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.143
- Well, were you?

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.373
Is it possible that you're
reading too much into it?

00:03:22.373 --> 00:03:24.700
- Are, are you serious?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.530
- All I'm saying is he's gotta be so used

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.810
to having girls throw themselves at him.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.683
Not that that excuses his behavior.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.740
It also happened right before you had

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.380
one of your stress-related incidents.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.990
- Wow. This is how it happens.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.767
- Stop. I do believe you.

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:45.593
But what exactly happened?

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.830
- I don't, I don't feel like
talking about it anymore.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.253
- Well, if it happened, you should.

00:03:53.965 --> 00:03:54.798
- If.

00:03:56.403 --> 00:04:00.153
- (sighs) Jesus. I'm trying.

00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:07.060
- You know what, let's just
drop it for now and go tonight.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.110
I need a distraction.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.656
(Mayra exhales)

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:14.489
(knuckles rapping)

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.350
(upbeat lively music)

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.183
- Hey!

00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:19.600
- Happy housewarming!
Brought you a plant to kill.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.244
- Thanks for the
compliments and the plant.

00:04:22.244 --> 00:04:23.077
Come on in.
- Good to see you.

00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:24.204
How you doing?

00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:25.167
Hey.
- Hi, how are you?

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:26.463
- Good.
- Great.

00:04:26.463 --> 00:04:27.497
- Mm, come have a drink.

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:28.497
- Thank you.

00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:34.640
(people chattering indistinctly)

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.140
- I think young Lucas has a crush on you.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.773
- I am so not in the right place for that.

00:04:42.854 --> 00:04:44.354
- What do you mean? He's cute.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.483
- (laughs) Okay, okay,
what's your guilty pleasure?

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:14.608
- I don't know.

00:05:14.608 --> 00:05:15.778
I don't have one.
- Come on, come on,

00:05:15.778 --> 00:05:17.570
everybody has one. (laughing)

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.563
- Okay. I guess, um, "House."

00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:23.678
- (gasps) "House"? I, I love "House."

00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:25.550
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.340
Wait, but that's not even embarrassing.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.980
Everybody loves "House." It's so good.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.920
- So good.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.114
- [Mayra] Yeah.

00:05:32.114 --> 00:05:34.086
(Lucas imitates drum beating)

00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:36.751
(laughs) No, I, (laughs)
I meant "House" the show.

00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:38.178
- Yeah, I know, no.

00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:40.428
(Mayra laughing)
Also, really bad. So sorry.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.942
(laughs) You are beautiful.

00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:47.158
- What? (laughs)

00:05:47.158 --> 00:05:48.770
- I said you're beautiful.
(Mayra laughs)

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.373
I'm trying to compliment you here.

00:05:50.373 --> 00:05:53.818
- [Mayra] That's a funny compliment.

00:05:53.818 --> 00:05:55.760
- Why is that a funny compliment?

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.260
- Uh, you might as well compliment me

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.650
for being a, a girl or not very tall or,

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.930
I don't know, uh, something else

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.763
that I was born with that
I have no control over.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.933
- Okay, all right, you might be right.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.570
I'm just trying to tell you I like you.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.450
- Oh, um, I, I'm sorry, I...

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.383
- Why are you apologizing?

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.983
- I should go.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.573
- [Lucas] Wait.

00:06:33.003 --> 00:06:36.730
- (exhales) I just, I, I
think I drank too much.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.330
- Yeah. Okay.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.271
Just let me help you.
- No, no, what are you,

00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:41.921
what are you, what are you doing?

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.134
- Trying to be nice.

00:06:44.134 --> 00:06:45.149
(dramatic intense music)

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:48.777
(electricity crackling)

00:06:48.777 --> 00:06:52.370
(upbeat lively music)

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.350
- There you are. Come on.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.693
I gotta tell you something.

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:07.983
Did that creep try anything with you?

00:07:07.983 --> 00:07:11.160
- No, I, I was just weirded out.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.482
I don't know. He's nice.

00:07:14.482 --> 00:07:18.170
- (chuckles) There's no
such thing. Are you okay?

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.080
- (exhales) Yeah, I
just, I need to sober up.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.520
- Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.

00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:29.407
(Mayra vomits)

00:07:31.548 --> 00:07:35.131
(gentle suspenseful music)

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:46.948
You're a scientist. What are you doing?

00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:16.462
(glass cracking)

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:19.545
(heartbeat thumping)

00:08:23.685 --> 00:08:24.518
What?

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.098
- [Dr. Booker] If it isn't
my most dedicated assistant.

00:08:56.098 --> 00:08:59.931
(dramatic suspenseful music)

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.160
- I was just headed out.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.930
- Come have some tea with me.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.990
I was a bit worried about
you after our last chat.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.150
They still haven't figured
out how the glass broke.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.983
- Oh.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.412
- [Dr. Booker] You don't
have any ideas, do you?

00:09:37.412 --> 00:09:38.829
- No, no, uh, no.

00:09:40.427 --> 00:09:41.800
- You know, you're not the first person

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.323
to faint in my office, sorry to say.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.185
Although it's usually from
exhaustion, not explosions.

00:09:50.185 --> 00:09:53.352
(Dr. Booker chuckles)

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.313
Go ahead, it won't burn you. Promise.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.170
Are you sure you're all right?

00:10:25.073 --> 00:10:27.656
(Mayra slurps)

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:33.260
I just wanted to say I'm here

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.723
if you need any guidance,
someone to talk to.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.020
I know my titles and publications

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.360
can make me seem a little
intimidating sometimes,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.660
but that shouldn't stop
us from being friends.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.180
You're a smart, beautiful woman,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.230
and I can tell you're dedicated
and you'll achieve a lot.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.380
I should be lucky to
count you as a friend.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.360
- Thank you, sir.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.663
- Please. How's gyokuro?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.920
- Uh, it's, it's really good. Thank you.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.382
- Good. Good.

00:11:09.382 --> 00:11:11.710
(dramatic suspenseful music continues)

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.943
Despite the caffeine,
I find it very calming.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.400
It's from my last trip to China.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:25.043
I find tea culture so
interesting, don't you?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.633
- I, I don't know much about it.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.393
- [Dr. Booker] You were saying?

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.882
- [Mayra] Was I?

00:11:41.882 --> 00:11:44.965
(heartbeat thumping)

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.906
(dramatic intense music)

00:11:48.906 --> 00:11:50.260
(Mayra gasping)

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.810
- I hope you don't mind my saying this,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.163
but you have the most remarkable eyes.

00:11:57.562 --> 00:11:58.395
- I,

00:11:59.825 --> 00:12:02.480
I, I should go.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.431
- Please don't.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.181
- No, I, I should go.

00:12:11.787 --> 00:12:14.089
(belt clinking)

00:12:14.089 --> 00:12:17.258
(electricity crackling)

00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:18.091
- What's happening?

00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:21.008
(glasses clinking)

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.303
(glass shattering)

00:12:25.303 --> 00:12:28.470
(Dr. Booker grunting)

00:12:42.157 --> 00:12:43.770
Ow!

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.853
(Dr. Booker gasping)

00:12:48.778 --> 00:12:52.361
(gentle suspenseful music)

00:12:54.747 --> 00:12:57.414
(Mayra gasping)

00:13:01.293 --> 00:13:04.710
(dramatic ominous music)
